# aoc_2024

Solutions for Advent of Code 2024 in Gleam.

## Usage:

```sh
gleam run day_5 # Run the solution for day 5
```

## Details

Each day's solution is implemented in a seperate module, e.g. `day_1`: [day_1](./src/day_1.gleam)

To help with some solutions, this project uses a shared `grid` module, see: [grid](./grid.html)

Additionally, some shared functionality is implemented in the `utils` module, see: [utils](./utils.html)
